## Technology Stack

### Django
A high-level Python web framework that allows rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. In this project, Django is used to build the backend, handling user requests, and interacting with the database. It also provides an admin interface for managing data.

### React
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. In this project, React is used to create the frontend of the application, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

### MySQL
A widely used open-source relational database management system. In this project, MySQL is used to store and manage the project's data. It allows efficient querying, storage, and retrieval of data for the application.

### Git
A distributed version control system that tracks changes to the project's source code. Git is used to manage versioning, facilitate collaboration, and ensure smooth code integration. GitHub is used to host the repository and track changes.

### RESTful APIs
A set of conventions for building web services that allow clients to interact with the backend. In this project, RESTful APIs are used to enable communication between the frontend (React) and backend (Django), allowing for CRUD operations and data manipulation via HTTP requests.

## Feature Breakdown

### User Management
The user management system allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures secure access to the platform, with different roles such as "Owner" and "Guest" to handle different levels of access and functionality.

### Property Management
Owners can add, update, and delete properties through the property management system. This feature allows users to list their properties, provide detailed descriptions, and manage their availability, which is crucial for enabling the booking process.

### Booking System
The booking system enables guests to search, view, and book properties for specific dates. This feature is critical for facilitating property rentals, allowing users to make reservations, track booking details, and ensure properties are booked properly.

### Review System
Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature helps build trust within the community by allowing future guests to evaluate properties based on others' experiences.

### Payment Processing
The payment system handles secure transactions for bookings. It ensures that users can pay for their bookings through various payment methods, with transaction details securely stored for record-keeping.

## API Security

### Authentication
Authentication ensures that users are who they claim to be. In this project, **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are used to authenticate users. This ensures that only legitimate users can access protected resources by verifying their identity using a token.

**Why it's crucial**: Authentication is essential to protect sensitive user data (e.g., personal information, booking history) from unauthorized access.

### Authorization
Authorization ensures that authenticated users can only perform actions or access data that they are allowed to. This project implements **role-based access control (RBAC)**, where users are assigned roles such as "Owner" or "Guest", each with specific permissions to interact with different parts of the system.

**Why it's crucial**: Authorization helps protect resources by ensuring users cannot access or modify data they are not permitted to (e.g., a guest should not be able to delete a property).

### Rate Limiting
To protect the API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, **rate limiting** is implemented using tools like **API Gateway** or **NGINX**. This limits the number of requests a user can make within a set time frame (e.g., 100 requests per minute).

**Why it's crucial**: Rate limiting helps prevent abuse and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, ensuring the API remains available and responsive for all users.

### Data Encryption
Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment details, is encrypted both in transit (using **SSL/TLS**) and at rest (using appropriate encryption algorithms). For example, user passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before storing them in the database.

**Why it's crucial**: Encryption ensures that user information is protected from unauthorized access or interception during transmission or storage.

### Input Validation and Sanitization
All user input is validated and sanitized to prevent malicious code (e.g., SQL injection, XSS attacks). We use libraries and frameworks like **Django ORM** to handle input safely, avoiding direct SQL queries and ensuring data is properly filtered.

**Why it's crucial**: Proper input validation and sanitization are critical to avoid vulnerabilities that can compromise the integrity of the system and data, protecting users from security breaches.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) are practices aimed at automating the software development lifecycle. CI ensures that code changes are frequently integrated and tested, while CD automates the deployment process to deliver code to production environments.

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically builds and tests the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository, helping to ensure that new code integrates smoothly with the existing codebase.
- **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)**: Automates the deployment of the application to various environments (e.g., staging, production) after passing tests, making sure that the software is always in a deployable state.

### Why is CI/CD Important?
- **Faster Development**: With CI/CD, new features, bug fixes, and improvements are delivered more quickly.
- **Improved Quality**: Automated tests help identify bugs and issues early in the development process, improving the overall quality of the software.
- **Consistency**: Automation ensures that deployments are consistent and predictable, reducing human error.
- **Reliability**: By automating the entire process, CI/CD helps ensure that code changes are tested and deployed in a controlled, error-free manner.

### Tools for CI/CD
Several tools can be used to implement a CI/CD pipeline, including:

- **GitHub Actions**: A powerful tool integrated with GitHub for automating workflows, such as testing and deployment.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the application, ensuring consistent environments across different stages of development and deployment.
- **Jenkins**: A widely-used automation server for building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Travis CI**: A cloud-based service for running automated tests and deployments on GitHub repositories.
- **CircleCI**: A continuous integration platform that helps automate development workflows, from building and testing to deployment
